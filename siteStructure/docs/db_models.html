Regions
	Region: String

	Can contain any type

Every type has an Area attribute.

Reason for separating Region, Address, and Location is do to querying and information given. If a region is listed, there is no need to search the Location against the Region collection. A Location attribute is for map display.

I don't think we should store objects within each Region. Once the object type is queried against and placed within a region, it will become listed within its attribute. So there will only be 17 documents (objects) within the Regions collection. We can then create an index on each region attribute on every object.
